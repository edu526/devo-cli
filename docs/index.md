# Devo CLI

Developer productivity CLI for Git workflows and AWS management.

## What is Devo CLI?

Devo CLI is a command-line tool that streamlines daily development tasks — from committing changes and reviewing code to managing AWS resources like DynamoDB, SSM, EventBridge and CodeArtifact. It uses AWS Bedrock internally for the `commit` and `code-reviewer` commands.

## Key Features

- **Commit Automation**: Generate conventional commit messages from staged changes using AWS Bedrock
- **Code Review**: Automated code analysis with security checks and best practices validation
- **AWS SSO**: Authentication and credential management across multiple profiles
- **DynamoDB**: Table management and data export (CSV, JSON, JSONL, TSV)
- **SSM Session Manager**: Connect to private instances and databases via port forwarding
- **EventBridge**: Enable, disable and describe rules
- **CodeArtifact**: Authenticate with private package registries
- **Shell Completion**: Tab completion support for bash, zsh, and fish
- **Self-Updating**: Keep your CLI up-to-date with a single command
- **Standalone Binaries**: No Python installation required
